## Just a basic homepage I am making for my home media system

### Features: 
- Big easy to click links
- Theme menu

### **Plans:**  
- import/export Themes via JSON 
- random theme generated from nice color pallet
- Goofy websites menu
- Special themes (Big *maybe*)
- And anything else I might think of later

<!-- 
Special Theme ideas:
No Bitches?
Craiyon <-- Higher Priority, if I lazily hardcode only one special theme I want it to be this
