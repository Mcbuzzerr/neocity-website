                    I don't have an actual normal kitkat with me at this moment,
                    but I can still tell you it's pretty alright. It's the baseline
                    for all the other kitkats, so it's not bad, but not mind blowing either.

                    This was the first kitkat I tried, and I was mostly confused. I guess that's fitting.
                    I shared this one with my girlfriend, and we both agreed that we had no clue what it was.
                    It had som purplish coloring on the inside, and it was a bit fruity. I think it may have been grape.
