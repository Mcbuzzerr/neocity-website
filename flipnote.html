                        This drawing is mostly just a bunch of squiggles. It's a classic warmup exercise without even
                        intending to be. I don't remember the exact order, but I did the yellow for noise, then I felt
                        inspired by audio levels and maybe cacti or creepers for the green poles, they kinda look like a
                        city skyline now that I'm looking at it. The red is meant to be an intruding observer, something
                        like an eye or a ufo. The blue bubbles are there because I felt like it, or whatever reason it
                        was I
                        forgor ðŸ’€.

                        This one is a little more straightforward. I was still warming up and I wanted to mess around
                        with the textures so I did the classic "Green hill, blue sky, white cloud, yellow sun in corner"
                        drawing that everyone has done as a kid. Then I added sonic because I thought the trail was a
                        good use for the textures I was experimenting with

                        I really wanted to push my ability to do detail with this one, I wanted it to be a clearly
                        blocky minecraft landscape. That did't really end up happening, the contrast between the two
                        different shades of sand also got absolutely obliterated when I exported the frames... I added a
                        cat after I accepted that it kinda just looked like a regular desert, I like the cat addition,
                        it saved it for me :)

                        All of these doodles were happening while I was waiting and listening during DnD. We're a band
                        of pirates and I had recently been playing Phantom Hourglass, so as a Wind Waker fan this
                        obviously put the better game on my mind and the king of red lions kinda just came to me while
                        doodling. I couldn't quite remember the details, but I like how it turned out! Our campaign is
                        on hiatus as of a day or so of writing and I wonder when/if we'll be back

                        You should probably read these in order, I drew them in an order and I'm writing about them in
                        an order, so it'll just make more sense to follow along. Anyways, this is a pigeon! I was
                        reaching peak boredom levels during DnD and I wanted to draw something simple so I drew a pigeon
                        for my GF.

                        At this point we reach the boredom + experimenting with new medium sweet spot. I drew a skull,
                        then made a few copies and did a different top layer for each. I didn't end up exporting all of
                        them to my PC and I might go back to do that. This mossy skull is when I really popped off with
                        my shading and layer usage. After this drawing I went back to the previous ones and added
                        shading to them as well. I'm really happy with how this one turned out, I think it's my favorite

                        There were two skulls I remember not exporting: a skull with red eyes and serious shading that I
                        didn't love how serious it felt abd a low effort sans. Finally the one I did export: this
                        one is inspired by the minecraft painting that it looks like. I like that painting because it's
                        actually a real painting, and that painting's sketch is a digital piece that includes the
                        minecraft fire particle sprite. Its process was digital->physical->digital and that's how a
                        lot of the paintings are! Isn't that neat?

                        I was still on an inverted color skull kick from the previous batch of skulls so I did some
                        reverse etching. I filled the screen black then erased and drew this. The goal was a lot of
                        abstract lines that I was roughly resemble a skeleton. Then I kept adding more :)

                        The pumpkin was just a shading doodle, I discovered that I can zoom in with R or L and an on
                        screen button. When zoomed in you can use all your regular tools, but the width is forced to 1.
                        I was testing out zooming in to add fine shading lines along my other ones. I also wanted to
                        make orange, a color that isn't on the palette. Also maybe don't look into the relationship
                        between trans girls and pumpkins :3

                        I drew the zombie to test out drawing the blood with two different textures, we were also in the
                        middleof fighting a bunch of zombies. I actually happened to fall and have my warforged body
                        sink a zombie into the swamp mud and was prone for the duration of my time drawing this lol. The
                        design is something I kinda memorized, and it's semi inspired by Plants Vs. Zombies zombies. PvZ
                        on the DS is also a game I've been replaying recently, and during slow parts of DnD too!

                        a mini Van Gogh in my hands. Maybe he posessed me because he wanted to try DnD and left that as
                        a thank you from beyond the grave. I never thought about that, ghosts who know a creative craft
                        can offer you something from beyond the grave. All they gotta do is possess you and then make it
                        and boom you have a thing now, and they got to have a gross meat sack for a bit again! win! win!

                        It's the inside of a mouth. Theoretically the 3D view should look good too, but I have a 2DS so
                        I can't do 3D :( It looks like a uvula, I dunno what else to say. Oh I know what to say!
                        "Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh" Oh I just remembered what inspired this, I should say that. I was swallowed
                        by a froghemoth at this point, so I drew "POV: Ur getting eaten"

                        While my party and I were fighting the froghemoth I got downed, this is why I drew a graveyard.
                        Zombies had been on the mind as you have seen, so they obvisously made an appearance. I don't
                        eally like this drawing I think it's kinda bad. My character Gurrt ended up surviving their
                        encounter with the Froghemoth in the Ravenous Bog, but I think I would have been okay with him
                        dying. I did his sidequest and I like my new character idea.
