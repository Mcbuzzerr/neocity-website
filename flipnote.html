                        This drawing is mostly just a bunch of squiggles. It's a classic warmup exercise without even
                        intending to be. I don't remember the exact order, but I did the yellow for noise, then I felt
                        inspired by audio levels and maybe cacti or creepers for the green poles, they kinda look like a
                        city skyline now that I'm looking at it. The red is meant to be an intruding observer, something
                        like an eye or a ufo. The blue bubbles are there because I felt like it, or whatever reason it
                        was I
                        forgor ðŸ’€.

                        This one is a little more straightforward. I was still warming up and I wanted to mess around
                        with the textures so I did the classic "Green hill, blue sky, white cloud, yellow sun in corner"
                        drawing that everyone has done as a kid. Then I added sonic because I thought the trail was a
                        good use for the textures I was experimenting with

                        I really wanted to push my ability to do detail with this one, I wanted it to be a clearly
                        blocky minecraft landscape. That did't really end up happening, the contrast between the two
                        different shades of sand also got absolutely obliterated when I exported the frames... I added a
                        cat after I accepted that it kinda just looked like a regular desert, I like the cat addition,
                        it saved it for me :)

                        All of these doodles were happening while I was waiting and listening during DnD. We're a band
                        of pirates and I had recently been playing Phantom Hourglass, so as a Wind Waker fan this
                        obviously put the better game on my mind and the king of red lions kinda just came to me while
                        doodling. I couldn't quite remember the details, but I like how it turned out! Our campaign is
                        on hiatus as of a day or so of writing and I wonder when/if we'll be back

                        You should probably read these in order, I drew them in an order and I'm writing about them in
                        an order, so it'll just make more sense to follow along. Anyways, this is a pigeon! I was
                        reaching peak boredom levels during DnD and I wanted to draw something simple so I drew a pigeon
                        for my GF.

                        At this point we reach the boredom + experimenting with new medium sweet spot. I drew a skull,
                        then made a few copies and did a different top layer for each. I didn't end up exporting all of
                        them to my PC and I might go back to do that. This mossy skull is when I really popped off with
                        my shading and layer usage. After this drawing I went back to the previous ones and added
                        shading to them as well. I'm really happy with how this one turned out, I think it's my favorite

                        There were two skulls I remember not exporting: a skull with red eyes and serious shading that I
                        didn't love how serious it felt abd a low effort sans. Finally the one I did export: this
                        one is inspired by the minecraft painting that it looks like. I like that painting because it's
                        actually a real painting, and that painting's sketch is a digital piece that includes the
                        minecraft fire particle sprite. Its process was digital->physical->digital and that's how a
                        lot of the paintings are! Isn't that neat?

                        I was still on an inverted color skull kick from the previous batch of skulls so I did some
                        reverse etching. I filled the screen black then erased and drew this. The goal was a lot of
                        abstract lines that I was roughly resemble a skeleton. Then I kept adding more :)

                        The pumpkin was just a shading doodle, I discovered that I can zoom in with R or L and an on
                        screen button. When zoomed in you can use all your regular tools, but the width is forced to 1.
                        I was testing out zooming in to add fine shading lines along my other ones. I also wanted to
                        make orange, a color that isn't on the palette. Also maybe don't look into the relationship
                        between trans girls and pumpkins :3

                        I drew the zombie to test out drawing the blood with two different textures, we were also in the
                        middleof fighting a bunch of zombies. I actually happened to fall and have my warforged body
                        sink a zombie into the swamp mud and was prone for the duration of my time drawing this lol. The
                        design is something I kinda memorized, and it's semi inspired by Plants Vs. Zombies zombies. PvZ
                        on the DS is also a game I've been replaying recently, and during slow parts of DnD too!

                        It's the inside of a mouth. Theoretically the 3D view should look good too, but I have a 2DS so
                        I can't do 3D :( It looks like a uvula, I dunno what else to say. Oh I know what to say!
                        "Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh" Oh I just remembered what inspired this, I should say that. I was swallowed
                        by a froghemoth at this point, so I drew "POV: Ur getting eaten"

                        While my party and I were fighting the froghemoth I got downed, this is why I drew a graveyard.
                        Zombies had been on the mind as you have seen, so they obvisously made an appearance. I don't
                        eally like this drawing I think it's kinda bad. My character Gurrt ended up surviving their
                        encounter with the Froghemoth in the Ravenous Bog, but I think I would have been okay with him
                        dying. I did his sidequest and I like my new character idea.

                        I drew a bunch on different days, then I exported a cherry picked selection of them. I'm only

                        the edge of the event horizon. This is one of the first artpieces where I went in with a goal
                        and came out
                        with something closely resembling that goal. I'm happy with how it turned out, but it doesn't
                        really have
                        emotion tied to it like some of the other ones do. I might go back and redo the stars.

                        This was inspired by my misremembering of the pangram "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow"
                        thinking it had
                        an obelisk in it. It was also more directly inspired by an animation by AnasAbdin called
                        "Monolith". This piece
                        is super derivative, but its mistakes and medium make it unique.

                        This was another attempt at a space scene that feels like Starry Night. This time I got more
                        abstract with it
                        and made it look more blobby less space-y. I like how it turned out, but this is an example of a
                        drawing that
                        I have a plan for and it turns out different than I expected.

                        This was an abstract warmup in the same vein as the first one. I wanted to add a little more
                        texture to my
                        usual abstract patterns so I did! Nothing else to say about this one, it's just a warmup.

                        This piece was just warmup doodling. I wouldn't normally post it, but I realized artists rarely
                        post their
                        scribbles and warmups. I think it's important to show that this is the kind of stuff I make, I
                        don't just
                        make super cool space drawings, I also make scribbles.

                        I don't think the goal for these was to warmup, I think I just wanted to pass time and create
                        something.
                        Creating a piece with intricate detail sounds fun until it becomes dull and repetitive.

                        Swirls and curls are simply satisfying to draw to me. You can apply the previous 2 descriptions
                        to this one as well.
                        The -y trilogy could all have the same description, but I'm split it between them.

                        This has to be my favorite drawing so far. I drew this at a family event with the goal of
                        drawing space.
                        It turned out way prettier than I had expected, and I'm really happy with it!
